  abstract = {Lineage tracking delivers essential quantitative insight into dynamic, probabilistic cellular processes, such as somatic tumor evolution and differentiation. Methods for high diversity lineage quantitation rely on sequencing a population of DNA barcodes. However, manipulation of specific individual lineages is not possible with this approach. To address this challenge, we developed a functionalized lineage tracing tool,~Control of Lineages~by Barcode Enabled Recombinant Transcription (COLBERT),~that enables high diversity lineage tracing and lineage-specific manipulation of gene expression. This modular platform utilizes expressed barcode gRNAs to both track cell lineages and direct lineage-specific gene expression.}

  abstract = {Quality control and preprocessing of FASTQ files are essential to providing clean data for downstream analysis. Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such as quality control, adapter trimming and quality filtering. These tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high-level programming languages (e.g. Python and Java) and provide limited multi-threading support. Reading and loading data multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient.We developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per-read quality pruning and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multi-threading support. Based on our evaluation, fastp is 2--5 times faster than other FASTQ preprocessing tools such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt despite performing far more operations than similar tools.The open-source code and corresponding instructions are available at https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp.}

  abstract = {Treatment-persistent residual tumors impede curative cancer therapy. To understand this cancer cell state we generated models of treatment persistence that simulate the residual tumors. We observe that treatment-persistent tumor cells in organoids, xenografts, and cancer patients adopt a distinct and reversible transcriptional program resembling that of embryonic diapause, a dormant stage of suspended development triggered by stress and associated with suppressed Myc activity and overall biosynthesis. In cancer cells, depleting Myc or inhibiting Brd4, a Myc transcriptional co-activator, attenuates drug cytotoxicity through a dormant diapause-like adaptation with reduced apoptotic priming. Conversely, inducible Myc upregulation enhances acute chemotherapeutic activity. Maintaining residual cells in dormancy after chemotherapy by inhibiting Myc activity or interfering with the diapause-like adaptation by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 9 represent potential therapeutic strategies against chemotherapy-persistent tumor cells. Our study demonstrates that cancer co-opts a mechanism similar to diapause with adaptive inactivation of Myc to persist during treatment.},

We developed a functionalized lineage-tracing system, ClonMapper, which integrates DNA barcoding with single-cell RNA sequencing and clonal isolation to comprehensively characterize thousands of clones within heterogeneous populations. Using ClonMapper, we identified subpopulations of a chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line with distinct clonal compositions, transcriptional signatures and chemotherapy survivorship trajectories; patterns that were also observed in primary human chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The ability to retrieve specific clones before, during and after treatment enabled direct measurements of clonal diversification and durable subpopulation transcriptional signatures. ClonMapper is a powerful multifunctional approach to dissect the complex clonal dynamics of tumor progression and therapeutic response.},

  abstract = {A significant challenge in the field of biomedicine is the development of methods to integrate the multitude of dispersed data sets into comprehensive frameworks to be used to generate optimal clinical decisions. Recent technological advances in single cell analysis allow for high-dimensional molecular characterization of cells and populations, but to date, few mathematical models have attempted to integrate measurements from the single cell scale with other types of longitudinal data. Here, we present a framework that actionizes static outputs from a machine learning model and leverages these as measurements of state variables in a dynamic model of treatment response. We apply this framework to breast cancer cells to integrate single cell transcriptomic data with longitudinal bulk cell population (bulk time course) data. We demonstrate that the explicit inclusion of the phenotypic composition estimate, derived from single cell RNA-sequencing data (scRNA-seq), improves accuracy in the prediction of new treatments with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.92 compared to a prediction accuracy of CCC = 0.64 when fitting on longitudinal bulk cell population data alone. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly integrates single cell clonally-resolved transcriptome datasets with bulk time-course data to jointly calibrate a mathematical model of drug resistance dynamics. We anticipate this approach to be a first step that demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating multiple data types into mathematical models to develop optimized treatment regimens from data.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The increasing throughput of sequencing technologies offers new applications and challenges for computational biology. In many of those applications, sequencing errors need to be corrected. This is particularly important when sequencing reads from an unknown reference such as random DNA barcodes. In this case, error correction can be done by performing a pairwise comparison of all the barcodes, which is a computationally complex problem.Results: Here, we address this challenge and describe an exact algorithm to determine which pairs of sequences lie within a given Levenshtein distance. For error correction or redundancy reduction purposes, matched pairs are then merged into clusters of similar sequences. The efficiency of starcode is attributable to the poucet search, a novel implementation of the Needleman--Wunsch algorithm performed on the nodes of a trie. On the task of matching random barcodes, starcode outperforms sequence clustering algorithms in both speed and precision.Availability and implementation: The C source code is available at http://github.com/gui11aume/starcode.Contact: ~guillaume.filion@gmail.com}
